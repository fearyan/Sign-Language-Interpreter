# Sign Language Interpreter

## Overview

The Sign Language Interpreter project is designed to facilitate communication between hearing and non-hearing individuals by translating sign language gestures into text using computer vision techniques. This project leverages Python libraries for image processing and machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Uses webcam input to detect and interpret sign language gestures on the fly.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a trained model that can accurately recognize various signs.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fearyan/Sign-Language-Interpreter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Sign-Language-Interpreter
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the sign language interpreter, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python interpreter.py
```

Make sure your webcam is enabled and positioned correctly to capture your gestures.
